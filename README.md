## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts detailed laptop information from Flipkart, one of India's leading e-commerce platforms. It showcases my ability to:

* **Automate data collection:** Efficiently gather large datasets from dynamic websites.
* **Handle HTML parsing:** Extract relevant information from complex web page structures.
* **Clean and structure data:** Transform raw data into a usable format for analysis.

This project is not just a script; it's a demonstration of how I can leverage programming to solve real-world data acquisition challenges.

## Key Features

* **Robust Scraping:** Utilizes `requests` and `Selenium` to reliably extract data even with website changes.
* **Comprehensive Data Extraction:** Gathers laptop names, prices, specifications (processor, RAM, storage, etc.), ratings, and other relevant details.
* **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Implements data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and format data for analysis.
* **Structured Output:** Saves the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame, which can be easily exported to CSV or other formats.
* **Modular Design:** The code is structured for easy understanding and modification.
* **Scalability:** The code can be modified to scrape other categories or websites.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` package manager
* Required Python libraries: `requests`, `Selenium`, `pandas` (install using `pip install package_name`)

### Usage

1.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Scrape-Flipkart-Laptop-Data.ipynb`.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Scrape-Flipkart-Laptop-Data.ipynb
    ```

2.  Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the scraping process.

3.  The scraped data will be saved as a CSV file (or within the notebook's dataframe) in the project directory.
